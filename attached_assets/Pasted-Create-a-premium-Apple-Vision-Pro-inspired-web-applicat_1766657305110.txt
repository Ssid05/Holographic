Create a premium Apple Vision Pro–inspired web application called Holo AI Web using React + TypeScript + Vite with an ultra-clean Apple-style UI.
🎨 Design & UI (VERY IMPORTANT)
Apple Vision Pro–level design (glassmorphism, depth blur, smooth animations)
Dark futuristic background with soft gradients
Floating dock at bottom (Apple style) with ONLY 5 apps
Zero clutter, zero debug overlays
No unnecessary blue lights or hand-tracking visuals in normal mode
60fps smooth animations and transitions
🧠 Core Concept
A touch-less, gesture-controlled + voice-controlled web interface (Jarvis-style) that works using:
Camera
Hand gestures (air commands)
Voice commands
✋ Hand Registration (Security Gate)
On first launch, show hand registration screen
Ask user to show front and back of BOTH hands
Show holographic hand skeleton ONLY during registration
After registration → hide all hand visuals completely
If hands are not registered → NOTHING should work
🖐️ Gesture Controls (Both Hands)
Support left & right hand
Any finger can be used
Gestures:
Point finger → hover/select app
Thumb + index pinch (snap sound / chetika) → select
Hold pinch (1s) → open app
Hold pinch (2s) → close app
Show both hands + open/close fists 3 times → turn camera ON/OFF
No visible cursor, only subtle glow on selected icon
🎙️ Voice Commands (Jarvis-Style)
Natural language voice recognition
AI voice replies (human-like)
Example commands:
“Open weather”
“What is my current location?”
“Tell today’s temperature”
“Close app”
Voice + gesture should work together seamlessly
📱 Apps (ONLY 5)
Assistant – talks back like Jarvis
Weather – detects current location & speaks result
Calculator – gesture + voice input
Notes – voice dictation
Music – play/pause with gestures
⚙️ Tech Requirements
React + TypeScript
Vite
MediaPipe Hands (or equivalent)
Web Speech API (voice in/out)
Modular clean folder structure
Production-ready code (no mockups)
🚫 Strict Rules
No debug text
No hand dots/lines after registration
No placeholder UI
No template leftovers
Must feel like Apple product demo
